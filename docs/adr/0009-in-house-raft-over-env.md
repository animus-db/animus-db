# ADR 0009 — In-house Raft over the `Env` seam (deviation from openraft)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-01

## Context

The bootstrap brief suggests `openraft` (or `raft-rs`) for control-plane
consensus. Independently, ADR 0003 makes determinism non-negotiable: *all*
nondeterminism — time, task scheduling, network, randomness — must flow through
the `Env` seam so a run is byte-reproducible from a seed, and the M3 acceptance
criteria require exactly that (leader election and leader-kill survival,
replayable from a seed, under `SimEnv`).

`openraft` drives its own time (timers), spawns its own `tokio` tasks, and owns
its own RPC scheduling. None of that goes through our `Env`, so it cannot be
driven by the single-threaded, virtual-clock `SimEnv`; its election timeouts and
task interleavings would be real-time and nondeterministic. Making it
deterministic would mean forking it or adopting `madsim` wholesale now — a much
larger commitment than M3 warrants.

## Decision

For the M3 control-plane skeleton we will implement a **small, self-contained
Raft** (leader election + log replication + commit + apply) as a *synchronous*
`RaftCore` state machine that runs entirely over `Env`: a thin per-node driver
owns the `Env` and feeds the core timer ticks and decoded messages, and the core
returns outbound messages and applies committed entries. All randomness
(election-timeout jitter) and time come from `Env`. This keeps the control plane
fully deterministic and replayable.

The core implements the safety-critical Raft rules (term/vote handling, log
up-to-dateness for votes, `AppendEntries` consistency check with conflict
truncation, commit only of current-term entries via majority `matchIndex`).

## Consequences

- The control plane is deterministic and testable under simulation today, which
  is the whole point of the project.
- We own and must maintain a Raft implementation. It is deliberately minimal.
  Durability is now implemented (follow-up to M3): the core emits a write-ahead
  log of hard-state/log/checkpoint records that the driver `fsync`s before
  acting, and recovers from on startup (see `persist.rs`); the state machine is
  checkpointed so recovery does not re-apply (and thus double-apply) committed
  commands. **Still deferred:** WAL compaction/truncation (it grows unbounded),
  and a full in-simulation process *restart-and-rejoin* test — the latter needs
  the simulator to support stopping and replacing a node's tasks, which it does
  not yet; recovery is currently validated at the `RaftCore` level.
- If we later need the maturity of `openraft`, the `Env`-driven boundary (a sync
  core + an I/O driver) is a clean place to swap implementations, and a `madsim`
  backend behind `Env` (ADR 0003) would let a third-party Raft run
  deterministically.
- This ADR supersedes the brief's dependency suggestion for the control plane;
  ADR 0001 (two-plane architecture) is otherwise unchanged.
