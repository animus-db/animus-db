# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

It is deliberately a **thin, method-focused entry point**: how to work here, the
load-bearing constraints, and a map of where things live. It does **not** restate
design *rationale* (that lives in the ADRs, `docs/adr/`) or per-crate *mechanism*
(that lives in each crate's `CLAUDE.md`). Those are the source of truth — keep
*them* current on decisions and details, not this file.

## What this is

AnimusDB is a masterless, linearly-scalable NoSQL database in Rust (Dynamo
lineage). It pairs a **leaderless AP data plane** (tunable quorum consistency)
with a small **strongly-consistent Raft control plane** that owns cluster
metadata. Correctness is established by **deterministic simulation testing**.

Status: pre-alpha. For *what's implemented* and *why*, read the ADR index
([`docs/adr/README.md`](docs/adr/README.md)) and the per-crate guides below —
this file does not keep a feature changelog.

## Per-crate guides

Each crate has its own `CLAUDE.md` with local entry points and gotchas — read
the relevant one before working in a crate:

| `animus-env` | [crates/animus-env/CLAUDE.md](crates/animus-env/CLAUDE.md) |
| `animus-sim` | [crates/animus-sim/CLAUDE.md](crates/animus-sim/CLAUDE.md) |

## Commands

```sh
cargo build --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --workspace
cargo test -p animus-control                       # one crate
cargo test -p animus-control --test control_raft   # one test binary
cargo test -p animus-control survives_leader_kill  # one test by name substring
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo deny check                                   # licenses + advisories (cargo install cargo-deny)
```

All five (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, build, test, deny) must be green; CI runs
them. Commits require a DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`); this repo is also set up
for GPG-signed commits.

### Replaying a failed simulation

Every simulation run is a pure function of its seed. Tests print the seed in
assertion messages; replay with `ANIMUS_SEED=<seed> cargo test <name>`. The
`Simulator` is driven by `Simulator::new(seed)`.

## The load-bearing constraint: determinism

This is the single most important rule (ADR 0003). **All nondeterminism flows
through the `Env` seam.** In every crate except `animus-env`'s `ProdEnv` and
test code:

- No wall clock — use `env.now()` / `env.sleep()`, never `std::time` or
  `tokio::time`.
- No raw task spawning — use `env.spawn_task(..)`, never `tokio::spawn`.
- No real I/O — use `env.send`/`recv` and `env.append`/`sync`/`read`, never
  `std::net`/`std::fs`/`tokio::{net,fs}`.
- No unseeded randomness — use `env.next_u64()` / `env.gen_below(..)`, never
  `thread_rng`/`OsRng`.
- **No `HashMap`/`HashSet` in logic** — their iteration order is
  nondeterministic. Use `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet`. This is lint-enforced via
  `clippy.toml`.

Components are generic over `E: Env` (monomorphized, never `dyn`). `Env` is a
supertrait combining `Clock + Rng + Network + Disk + Spawner`, scoped to one
node id. Production wiring uses `ProdEnv` (the only place real time/IO/RNG
live); tests use `animus-sim`'s `SimEnv`.

When a design decision changes, update the relevant ADR in `docs/adr/` in the
same change.

## Architecture map (where things live)

One line of orientation per subsystem — *what it is, its ADR (the why), and the
crate (the mechanism)*. The per-crate `CLAUDE.md` and the ADRs are the source of
truth; this map is just for navigation.

- **`Env` seam + simulator** — `animus-env`, `animus-sim` (ADR 0003). The single
  boundary for time/rng/network/disk/spawn. `SimEnv` is the deterministic
  single-threaded executor; `ProdEnv` the real one. Drive sims with
  `run_for`/`run_until`, never `run()` for protocols with perpetual timers.
- **Two planes** — ADR 0001. A consistent Raft **control plane** (`animus-control`,
  owns `Metadata` = membership + tablet map) vs a leaderless-AP **data plane**
  (`animus-data`, serving reads/writes from a *cached* `TabletView` so a
  control-plane outage doesn't stop I/O). See `animus-data/tests/two_plane.rs`.
- **Control-plane Raft** — `animus-control` (ADR 0009; in-house, not openraft, so
  `SimEnv` can drive it). Sync I/O-free `RaftCore` + thin `RaftNode<E>` driver;
  WAL + truncating/chunked-`InstallSnapshot` snapshots; epoch-CAS placement;
  heartbeat **failure detection** (ADR 0012); a replicated **table-schema
  catalog** in `Metadata` (ADR 0013).
- **Data plane** — `animus-data` (ADR 0001). `serve_replica` + the `DataClient`
  quorum coordinator; per-tablet **epoch fencing** (ADR 0002); pick `R+W>N`.
  Convergence via read-repair + segment-digest anti-entropy + hinted handoff,
  all **residency-bounded** (ADR 0010, 0005). An ack means the write durably
  applied.
- **Placement & residency** — `animus-placement` (ADR 0005). Pure policy engine
  (RF + residency labels + failure-domain spread); the leader auto-reconciles
  tablet placement via `reconcile_loop`.
- **Transaction consensus** — `animus-consensus` (ADR 0011). An Accord slice in
  the same shape as the Raft core: sync `AccordCore` + `AccordNode<E>`; durable
  execution, coordinator failover, message retry, read / data-plane-backed /
  sharded / interactive transactions.
- **Storage** — `animus-storage` (ADR 0004, 0008). The **async** `StorageEngine`
  trait; `MemoryEngine` (deterministic, for sim) and a custom on-disk
  `LsmEngine<E>` (WAL/SSTable/leveled compaction, all I/O via the `Env` disk seam
  so its crash recovery is sim-tested).
- **Wire adapters** — `animus-dynamo`, `animus-cql` (ADR 0006). DynamoDB JSON/HTTP
  and CQL v4, served by `animusd`, routed through the same `DataClient`; both
  consume the replicated schema catalog (ADR 0013).
- **Runnable node** — `animusd`, `animus-cli`. Assembles the three planes over
  `ProdEnv`; runs as one process (`animusd --cluster N`) or one per node
  (`animusd --config FILE --node I`).

**Cross-cutting gotcha — a node's inbox is single-consumer.** `Network::recv` for
a node id has exactly one consumer; never run two protocols (e.g. a control
`RaftNode` and a data replica) on the same node id (tests give control nodes
`0..3` and data replicas `3..6` distinct ids).

## Conventions

- One milestone / logical change per PR; keep diffs reviewable.
- Every distributed behavior lands with a fault-injecting simulation test that
  is reproducible from a seed.
- Higher layers define their own message enums and (de)serialize with
  `serde_json` over the `Vec<u8>` payloads the `Network` moves.

## Engineering practices (living — keep this current)

**Standing instruction (the mechanism): this section is append-only institutional
memory.** Whenever you — human or agent — discover a non-obvious lesson, gotcha,
or better way of working *during a task* (a bug whose root cause generalizes; a
test that caught what the gates didn't; a workflow misstep that cost time), **add
a one-line entry here, with the *why*, in the same change** — don't wait to be
asked. Every agent prompt for this repo must include: "if you learn a
generalizable lesson, record it in the root `CLAUDE.md` Engineering-practices
section (and the relevant crate guide) before you finish." Codebase-specific
gotchas also belong in that crate's `CLAUDE.md`; entries here are the
cross-cutting ones. Prune/merge entries that become obsolete.

### Testing
- **Determinism (ADR 0003) proves logic and ordering, not real-thread liveness.**
  `SimEnv` is single-threaded + cooperative, so a `Mutex` guard held across an
  `.await`, a lost waker, or a leader-election/group-commit deadlock can pass
  every sim test and only hang under the real multi-threaded `ProdEnv`. Any
  concurrency primitive (locks, waker handoffs, group commit, leader election)
  needs a **real `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]` over `ProdEnv`,
  timeout-guarded** so a deadlock fails loudly. (Found via the WAL group-commit
  deadlock; pattern in `animus-storage/tests/lsm_concurrent.rs`.)
- **`cargo bench -p animus-storage` (real `ProdEnv`) is a smoke test the
  deterministic suite is not** — it surfaced that same deadlock. Run it when
  touching the write/IO path.
- **A property checker only has teeth under the workload that can exercise it.**
  An Elle serializability check over *disjoint keys / single-writer-per-key* is
  near-trivial (no cross-transaction conflicts → no cycles). Point a
  serializability checker at the layer that *claims* it (Accord), drive
  **conflicting** transactions, and include a **negative control** (a known
  non-serializable history the checker must reject) so a passing run means
  something. The AP/LWW data plane should be checked for what it offers
  (read-your-writes, convergence), not serializability.
- **Prefer a frozen, *generated* scenario corpus over a live-randomized test.**
  Generate scenarios (cluster + workload + an explicit fault schedule) with
  randomness for breadth, but **materialize them into a committed, named set** so
  the suite is reproducible and a failure maps to a specific scenario — not a
  one-off RNG state. Aim for structured/combinatorial coverage of the fault
  matrix (fault type × target class × timing × workload); keep bug-finding
  scenarios in the corpus forever as regressions.
- **Never `let _ = storage.merge(...)` on the write path** — an ack must mean the
  write durably applied; surface storage errors so a non-durable write isn't
  counted toward the quorum (`animus-data` `ack_durability.rs`).

### Code patterns
- **No process-global mutable state (`OnceLock`/`static`) for per-instance
  concerns.** It leaks across tests in one binary (multiple in-process clusters
  share it) and conflates instances in any multi-tenant context. Thread state
  through a per-instance context instead (the wire edges' `ClusterEdgeState` via
  `ClientCtx`, not process statics). If you must keep a static, make sure tests
  tear instances down (`Node::shutdown()`) and use unique names/keys per test.
- **Never hold a `std::sync::Mutex` guard across an `.await`** in `<E: Env>`
  code — it breaks `Send` (often a *compile* error via `spawn_task`'s bound) and
  risks nondeterminism. Take the lock, mutate, drop it; do I/O lock-free.

### Merge / integration workflow
- **Run `cargo test --workspace` after *each* merge, not just at the end of a
  batch.** Batching the gate run let a regression onto master via an earlier
  merge before it was caught. All five gates (fmt, clippy `--all-features
  -D warnings`, build, test, `cargo deny`) green per merge.
- **`cargo deny` can be silently broken** (e.g. the repo's own `AGPL-3.0-only`
  missing from the allow-list) and it can't run in every local env — CI runs it;
  treat it as a real gate, not optional.
- **Don't `git add -A` while resolving a merge** — it can sweep agent worktree
  dirs in as embedded git repos. Stage explicit paths; `.claude/worktrees/` is
  gitignored to prevent it.
- **Doc files (`CLAUDE.md`, ADRs) conflict predictably** when parallel changes
  each edit the "what remains" lists — resolve by *unioning the done-states*
  (each side is usually stale only for the *other* change's feature).

### Parallel-agent orchestration
- **Partition work by disjoint crate ownership — exactly one owner per shared
  crate/file.** The assembly points (`animusd`, `animus-control`) are
  chokepoints; if several agents must touch `animusd`, split by *file*
  (`dynamo.rs` / `cql.rs` / `lib.rs`) and expect a small `lib.rs` merge.
- **Verify agent output yourself** (build + gates), don't trust the report —
  especially for safety-critical changes (a `SimEnv`/determinism edit) and after
  any agent died mid-run.
- **When an agent dies (API overload/stall/error), inspect its worktree before
  re-launching** — its partial work is often intact and finishable (or resumable
  via `SendMessage`); a lost worktree means redo. **Don't thrash re-launches
  during an API overload** — wait for it to ease.
- **Tell agents to keep public signatures stable** when a sibling depends on them
  (additive changes only), and to **stop-and-report rather than loop** on a
  transient API error.
