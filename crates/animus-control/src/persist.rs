//! Raft durable state (ADR 0009 follow-up).
//!
//! [`RaftCore`](crate::raft::RaftCore) is pure and does no I/O; instead it emits
//! [`WalRecord`]s describing changes to its durable state, which the node driver
//! appends to a write-ahead log on the `Env` disk and `fsync`s **before** acting
//! on them (granting a vote, acknowledging an append). On startup the driver
//! replays the log into a [`PersistedState`] and recovers the core.
//!
//! The state machine is snapshotted as a full [`Metadata`] image at a committed
//! `(last_index, last_term)`; the log keeps only entries *after* that index.
//! Recovery restores the snapshot, then re-applies the log tail as the leader
//! re-advances commit — so a committed command is applied exactly once relative
//! to the snapshot base (no double-applied compare-and-swap), while the log
//! prefix the snapshot covers is discarded.
